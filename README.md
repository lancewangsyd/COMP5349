# plz see softmax file, the code is based on andrew ng deep learning

#it should be noted that the code from andrew ng is binary classification(sigmoid) instead of softmax, so I defined softmax function, 
which is based on https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pjsadows/notes.pdf , 
https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book/blob/master/code/bonus/softmax-regression.ipynb

#within basic modules, momentum in SGD, dropout can also be based on andrew ng's work.
only weight norm need to be defined from scratch. 

#for extra modules, we must implement minibatch, otherwise would be too slow.
