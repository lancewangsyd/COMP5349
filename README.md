# the latest new version 6 is the latest file
# current modules: basic moduels except for weight norm. extra modules: minibatch

# plz see softmax file, the code is based on andrew ng deep learning
#https://github.com/andersy005/deep-learning-specialization-coursera

#it should be noted that the code from andrew ng is binary classification(sigmoid) instead of softmax, so I defined softmax function, 
which is based on https://www.ics.uci.edu/~pjsadows/notes.pdf , 
https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book/blob/master/code/bonus/softmax-regression.ipynb

#within basic modules, momentum in SGD, dropout can also be based on andrew ng's work.
only weight norm need to be defined from scratch.
